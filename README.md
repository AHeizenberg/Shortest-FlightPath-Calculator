# Shortest Flight Path Calculator :airplane:
The following is an implementation of the dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. In this implementation I alter the algorithm to calculate the shortest and fastest flight path between a take off and landing location given by the user. This is a completely dynamic program and can be used with any text based map.

## How to compile:

Commands:

    g++ shortest.cpp
    ./a.out map.txt


You can compile the file using the commands shown above. When you run the file please make sure to provide a text file that has an appropriate representation of a simplified map like the one provided in the repo. To make it easier for you I have provided a map.txt file which has this representation of the Canadian map.

## How to use the program:

When you run the program you will be prompted to enter 3 Canadian destinations using their airport code. Please note that in order for the program to run as desired these inputs must be correct 3 digit Canadian airport codes. Once you have entered the three correct airport codes the program will output a table showing the cost (total distance from source to destination), the number of hops (from source to destination) and the shortest path from the source to destination. In my program I have set the source to always be YYC (Calgaryâ€™s airport code) as we are situated in Calgary so all results will be from source YYC to whatever Canadian destinations that have been provided as inputs.
